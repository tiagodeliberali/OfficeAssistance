For example:
 - if the user says "I want to schedule an appointment", then you should choose this intent. 
 - if the user says "I want to schedule an appointment. Is it expensive?", then you do not choose this intent
 - if the user user ask indirectly to schedule an appointment, like: "Which days are available?", " Does she have any available time next week?", "Does she have any available time next week?", "Does she have any available time next week?", etc., you can choose this intent

SupplyMissingData: you should choose this intent when the user is still suppling data that you requested previously to schedule an appointment. For example, if the user says "Here is my email: tiago@test.com". Then you should choose this intent.

GeneralInformation: you should choose this intent when the user is asking for general information about the appointment. For example, if the user says "What is the address of the office?", then you should choose this intent.
